# Upliance Form Builder (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- The project uses localStorage to persist form schemas.
- Derived field formulas are plain JavaScript expressions that reference parent field IDs as variables.
- This is a ready-to-run starter; you can extend features (drag-and-drop, better formula editor, export/import).
